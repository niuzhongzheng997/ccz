# Project Aquila: Cloud Cost Monitoring Implementation Agenda

## 1. Objective & Business Requirements
**Primary Goal**: Implement a monitoring solution to track cloud computing costs generated by end-users utilizing Aquila Adhoc services on a weekly and monthly basis.

**Key Requirements**:
- Establish automated cost tracking for Aquila Adhoc resources
- Provide granular cost breakdown by user/service/time-period
- Support both weekly and monthly reporting cycles
- Integrate with existing Cortex AWS infrastructure patterns

## 2. Technical Implementation Approach
**Architecture Pattern**: Follow established Cortex AWS request methodology through API Gateway integration

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Leverage existing Cortex API Gateway patterns and standards
- Maintain consistency with current AWS service integration approaches
- Ensure compatibility with existing authentication/authorization mechanisms
- Adhere to Cortex naming conventions and deployment procedures

## 3. AWS Infrastructure & Permission Framework
**Required AWS Services & Data Flow**:
```
External Request → API Gateway → Lambda Function → Cost Explorer API → Response
```

**Permission Matrix Required**:

**API Gateway Permissions**:
- Execute Lambda functions
- Handle authentication/authorization
- Manage request/response transformation
- CloudWatch logging access

**Lambda Function Permissions**:
- Cost Explorer API access (`ce:GetCostAndUsage`)
- CloudWatch logging privileges
- Potential S3 access for cost data storage (if required)
- Tag-based resource filtering capabilities

**Cost Explorer Specific Permissions**:
- Read-only cost and usage data access
- Service-specific filtering (EC2, EBS, ECS, etc.)
- Tag-based cost allocation queries
- Cross-account cost data access (if applicable)

## 4. Data Query & Filtering Specifications
**Core Filtering Criteria**:
- **Time Period**: Weekly (7-day rolling) and Monthly (calendar month) intervals
- **Service Focus**: Compute resources (EC2, EBS, ECS, Lambda, etc.)
- **Tag Filtering**: `project = Aquila` AND `environment = Adhoc`
- **Granularity**: Daily breakdown for detailed analysis

**Additional Query Parameters**:
- Cost aggregation by service type
- User/resource owner identification
- Region-based cost distribution
- Instance type cost breakdown

## 5. Security & Compliance Considerations
**Access Control**:
- Implement least-privilege IAM roles
- API Gateway authentication mechanisms
- Cost data sensitivity classification
- Audit trail for all cost queries

**Data Protection**:
- Secure transmission (HTTPS/TLS)
- Minimal data exposure in responses
- Compliance with financial data handling policies
- Regular security review of permission sets

## 6. Implementation Phases & Timeline

**Phase 1: Foundation Setup** (Week 1-2)
- IAM role and permission configuration
- Basic Lambda function skeleton
- API Gateway endpoint creation
- Initial Cost Explorer query testing

**Phase 2: Core Functionality** (Week 3-4)
- Implement cost filtering logic
- Add tag-based filtering (Aquila Adhoc)
- Develop error handling and validation
- Create basic response formatting

**Phase 3: Integration & Testing** (Week 5-6)
- Integrate with Cortex API standards
- Implement authentication/authorization
- Performance testing and optimization
- Security review and penetration testing

**Phase 4: Deployment & Monitoring** (Week 7-8)
- Production deployment
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Documentation completion
- Team training and handover

## 7. Success Metrics & Validation
**Functional Validation**:
- Accurate cost retrieval for Aquila Adhoc resources
- Proper weekly/monthly aggregation
- Correct tag-based filtering
- API response time < 2 seconds

**Operational Metrics**:
- API availability > 99.9%
- Successful request rate > 95%
- Average response time monitoring
- Error rate tracking and alerting

## 8. Risk Mitigation Strategies
**Technical Risks**:
- Cost Explorer API rate limiting → Implement request throttling
- Permission escalation → Regular IAM policy audits
- Data accuracy → Validation against AWS Cost & Billing console
- API Gateway timeouts → Lambda function optimization

**Operational Risks**:
- Cost data sensitivity → Strict access controls
- Service dependencies → Fallback mechanisms
- Regulatory compliance → Regular compliance reviews

## 9. Stakeholder Review & Approval Points
**Required Approvals**:
- IAM permission matrix review (Security Team)
- API design and architecture (Platform Engineering)
- Cost data handling approach (Finance/Compliance)
- Production deployment readiness (Operations)

This agenda ensures systematic implementation of Aquila Adhoc cost monitoring while maintaining alignment with Cortex AWS standards and security requirements.
